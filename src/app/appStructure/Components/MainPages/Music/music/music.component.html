<p class="fs-4">It seems strange to talk about music, in a project that aims at the best version of yourself. Yet, music has the power to break emotional barriers. I still
   remember the first time I listened to 432Hz frequencies. Simply wow ðŸ˜®. When I went to sleep I remember having spasms. I was so worried about the situation that I didn't
   know what was happening. It was a time when I suffered a lot from anxiety. Then the next day, when I went to listen to that music again, intrigued by the effects, I
    casually read that in the first sessions of listening to this frequency, involuntary spasms and contractions can occur, due to the fact that it dissolves emotional blocks.
     At that moment I realized that I was full of emotional blocks! Since that day I have felt lighter and continue to listen to this magical frequency almost every day.
      It is important to say that not only this frequency has a positive impact on our feelings, others also do the same, and unfortunately others cause the opposite effect.
      I tell you one thing: a long time ago the international music frequency was changed and adapted from 432Hz to 440Hz. In time of war. And I don't know why. Do your research.

    <h2 class="py-3"> Music & Neurogenesis</h2>
    <p class="fs-4">
      Research indicates that active engagement in musical activities can stimulate the growth of gray matter in diverse brain regions, suggesting a profound impact on cognitive function.
       Notably, musical training has been associated with structural changes, influencing areas linked to motor skills, auditory processing, and executive functions. Beyond active
       participation, the act of listening to music itself holds significance, triggering the brain's reward system and releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter tied to pleasure. Neurotrophic
        factors, crucial for neurogenesis, appear influenced by musical activities, potentially fostering the growth and survival of neurons. Animal studies reinforce these findings,
      illustrating that exposure to enriched auditory environments, inclusive of music, can contribute to increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a key region for learning and memory.
      The evolving understanding of music's impact on neurogenesis underscores its potential as a tool for promoting brain health. While nuances in individual responses persist, the
      collectiveevidence suggests that the harmonious alliance of music and neurogenesis unveils a promising avenue for exploring the profound connections between art, cognition, and brain
      plasticity.

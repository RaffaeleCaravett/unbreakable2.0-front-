    <h2>Sleep superpower ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Testosterone</p>
        Adequate sleep is linked to healthy testosterone levels. Testosterone, a crucial hormone for various bodily
         functions, including muscle growth and repair, is often produced during deep sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
<p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Learning</p>
Quality sleep enhances cognitive functions, memory consolidation, and learning. During sleep, the brain processes
and organizes information, contributing to improved learning and problem-solving skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Longevity</p>
        Regular, sufficient sleep is associated with increased longevity. It supports overall health, reduces the risk of chronic
        diseases, and contributes to a healthier and longer life.

    <h2>Sleep deprivation ‚¨áÔ∏è</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Illnesses</p>
        Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to an increased risk of various health issues, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
        and obesity. Lack of sleep may compromise the body's ability to fight off illnesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Immune System</p>
        Sleep is vital for a robust immune system. Insufficient sleep can weaken the immune response, making the body more susceptible to
        infections and slowing down the recovery process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Sleep and Hormone Disruption</p>
        Lack of sleep can disrupt hormonal balance, affecting hormones related to stress, appetite, and growth. This imbalance may contribute
         to weight gain, increased stress levels, and a higher risk of metabolic disorders.
